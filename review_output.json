Introduction**\n\nThis literature review synthesizes findings from three pivotal papers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) research: \"A Comprehensive Survey on Automatic Text Summarization with Exploration of LLM-Based Methods\" (Zhanga et al., 2025), \"Attention Is All You Need\" (Vaswani et al., 2023), and \"Effectiveness in retrieving legal precedents: exploring text summarization and cutting-edge language models toward a cost-efficient approach\" (Mentzingen et al., 2025). These papers make substantial contributions to the understanding of automatic text summarization, large language models, and AI in legal precedents retrieval, particularly focusing on methodological innovation and the identification of research gaps for future investigation.\n\n**2. Thematic Synthesis**\n\n**2.1 Automatic Text Summarization Techniques**\n\nThe paper by Zhanga et al. (2025) provides a comprehensive survey on Automatic Text Summarization (ATS), particularly focusing on advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)-based methods. The authors developed an automated retrieval algorithm combining keyword-based searches with LLM-based prompt techniques, which streamlined the collection process of ATS research papers. However, the paper did not discuss potential challenges or limitations associated with using LLMs for ATS, such as the difficulty in controlling the output or issues related to data privacy and model interpretability.\n\n**2.2 Focus and Mindfulness: Attention Mechanisms in Language Models**\n\n\"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. (2023) presents a novel network framework, the Transformer, which is a sequence transduction model relying solely on attention mechanisms. The authors demonstrated that attention mechanisms are capable of handling long-distance dependencies in language sequences, anaphora resolution, and other linguistic constructs essential for understanding and generating coherent language sequences. However, the paper did not offer a detailed comparison of the Transformer model within different application contexts apart from machine translation and English constituency parsing.\n\n**2.3 Legal Text Mining and Summarization Techniques**\n\nMentzingen et al.'s (2025) research focused on the application of AI and text summarization techniques for retrieving legal precedents. The authors proposed a method that combines Named Entity Recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and embeddings from Language Models (LMs) to create summaries of legal documents. While the study made substantial contributions to precedent retrieval, it did not evaluate the performance of their system in a real-time legal environment or investigate the performance of similar techniques in other legal processes.\n\n**3. Research Gaps**\n\nDespite the significant advancements made in these studies, they also identified a number of research gaps. For instance, Zhanga et al. (2025) call for a comparison between LLM-based methods and traditional ATS methods to understand the improvement in quality, efficiency, or versatility brought about by these LLMs. Vaswani et al. (2023) emphasize the need for exploration and evaluation of the Transformer mechanism in other application areas such as speech recognition or text summarization. Meanwhile, Mentzingen et al. (2025) suggest further exploration of the performance of their methodologies across different legal jurisprudence systems and under real-time constraints.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, these papers make significant contributions to the field of NLP and AI research, particularly in ATS, attention mechanism, and legal precedents retrieval. They provide innovative methodologies and highlight crucial research gaps for future investigation. However, more research is needed to address the identified gaps and expand the application of these techniques in different contexts and conditions.",
